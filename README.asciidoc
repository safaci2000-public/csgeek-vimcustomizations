csgeek bundle
=============


Who is 'csgeek'?
----------------

That's me.  This is a plugin that's mostly designed for my own purposes.  It pulls some logic out of my .vimrc and makes it a bit cleaner and easier to read.


What is this asciidoc stuff
--------------------------- 

See http://www.asciidoc.com.  To generate an html version of this file run asciidoc README.ascii


Features
--------

Templates
~~~~~~~~~

create a template directory under your .vim/ directory.  if file doesn't exist, then it'll use the template you defined using the following convention extention.tmpl

For example.  vim ILoveToCode.java IF the file doesn't exist, it will look in .vim/template/ for a file named java.tmpl and use that as a prototype.

Custom Mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Ctrl+tab : next tab (same as firefox/chrome)
  * Ctrl+t   : new tab
  * Shift+Arrow : cycle through the various tabs.

GUI Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * nogui will remove most of the "GUI" elements from gvim.
 * gui   will reset what was removed.

Future?
-------

What's coming up next?  Probably adding some proper vimdocs to go with this plugin.  This will get a bit more robust as I learn more about vim development.
